# xRegistry multi-languages

<!-- no verify-links -->

xRegistry is a specification for describing event data in common formats.
As a textual specification, language barriers MAY slow down the progress of
understanding xRegistry for some people.
Thus, we welcome anyone to
[translate](../languages/languages-spec.md) the xRegistry specifications into
different languages.

This document acknowledges those who contribute whether by reviewing
translation works or translating English documents.

Thanks for everything you did to spread xRegistry.
